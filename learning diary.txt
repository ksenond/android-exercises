I began the Mobile Development module by reviewing the course information and watching the first video.
I installed Android Studio and created my first basic project. 
I also created a Git repository for the course and committed the initial files. 
Setting up the Android emulator and understanding the project structure was new to me, but it started making sense after some trial and error.

11.7.2025
I followed the instructions in Part 1 of the course and created a simple calculator app (Exercise 2). 
It performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 
I also added a custom background to practice working with layout and UI design. 
I learned how to use buttons, text fields, and the layout editor in Android Studio. 
I tested the app on different devices using the emulator.

Today I began planning the main idea for my final project. 
I wanted to build a cat-themed app with multiple screens and interactive features. 
I also completed another exercise app that had buttons that changed images, navigated to another screen, and showed a message on button press, as well as take you to the URL address. 
I practiced using Intent, startActivity, and updating UI elements dynamically.
I watched the third part of the video tutorial about ListView, and decided to not create a different exercise, but to implement learnt information directly into my app.

16.7.2025
I worked on Part 2 of the module, learning about core Android elements such as Activities, Intents, Services, and BroadcastReceivers. 
I started building the main framework for my final project, setting up the navigation between different screens using buttons and intents. 
I started experimenting with image uploads and layouts.

20.7.2025
I added major features to the final app:
A species screen with a ListView showing different cat species and images.
A my cat screen where the user can upload a photo and give their cat a name (using an image picker).
A photos screen with multiple circular image buttonsâ€”when you tap them, they show different cat images.
A video screen with buttons like Cute, Funny, Crazy that each open a specific YouTube video using an implicit intent.
A Surprise button on the video screen that displays a GIF of a cat.
An interesting facts button that takes you to the URL address with bunch of facts about cats.
This helped me learn how to work with ListView, ImageView, Intent, Media, and GIFs. I also started writing the README and preparing a screen recording for submission.

30.7.2025
I finalized the project. 
I tested everything thoroughly and fixed a few layout issues. 
I recorded a video of the app in action and uploaded it to YouTube. 
I added the video link to a README file and pushed all files to GitHub. 
I completed this Learning Diary and included all necessary instructions in the README file. 
Overall, I learned a lot about Android development, especially working with layouts, navigation, user input, and media.
